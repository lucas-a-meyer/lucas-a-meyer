# Lucas A. Meyer

After working on internal projects for many years, I haven't really kept my GitHub profile up-to-date. As of April 2022, I'm trying to finally get a little better at it, but it will still be under heavy construction for a while.

For now, the main thing that is accessible from it is my [blog](https://www.meyerperin.com), which is nothing more than a collection of my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasameyer) posts that received more than 50 reactions.
